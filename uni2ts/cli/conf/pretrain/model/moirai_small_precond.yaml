# Moirai Small model with preconditioning enabled
# Based on moirai_small.yaml with preconditioning configuration

defaults:
  - moirai_small

# Override preconditioning settings to enable it
enable_preconditioning: true
precondition_type: chebyshev  # chebyshev or legendre
precondition_degree: 5  # recommended: 2-10, paper suggests <= 10 for stability
loss_in_original_space: false
learnable_preconditioning: false

# Hybrid loss parameter for learnable preconditioning with loss_in_original_space=true
# The reconstruction loss = MSE(reverse(model_prediction), original_target)
# This encourages coefficients that don't amplify forecast errors during reversal
reversal_loss_weight: 0.1  # weight for reconstruction loss term
