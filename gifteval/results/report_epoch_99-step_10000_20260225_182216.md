## Aggregate Metrics (GIFT-Eval Leaderboard Style)

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Geometric Mean MASE** | **1.2929** | Primary leaderboard metric (scale-invariant) |
| Arithmetic Mean MASE | 2.6290 | Simple average |
| Median MASE | 1.1949 | Robust central tendency |
| MASE < 1.0 | 24/55 | Configs beating naive baseline |
| Min MASE | 0.3487 | Best single config |
| Max MASE | 63.3897 | Worst single config |

### Comparison to Reference Models

| Model | Params | MASE (Geo Mean) | MASE (Mean) | MASE < 1 |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| **This Model** | 11.75M | **1.2929** | 2.6290 | 24/97 |
| Moirai-small (official) | ~14M | 1.323 | 1.958 | 27/97 |
| Moirai-base (official) | ~90M | 1.259 | 2.019 | 40/97 |

*Note: Lower MASE is better. MASE < 1.0 means the model outperforms a seasonal naive baseline.*
